The main program file is script.js. First of all, it defines variables for different elements on the page and a variable for id of posts. Then it gets all the data from the local storage and displays it for a user.
Also it defines an event listener which allows user to add or change a post. At the end I created functions to display all of the posts, to edit the post and to remove the post.
